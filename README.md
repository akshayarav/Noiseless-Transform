The README should provide a compre-
hensive overview of the project, including the chosen paper, the specific result reproduced,
instructions for running the code, and an analysis of the re-implementation results in the
context of the original paper’s findings.

The purpose of the README is to provide a TLDR snapshot of your work targeted towards
anyone landing on your GitHub Repo. This is NOT A report! You can use the sample
README here for reference.
Note that most of the content can be copied over concisely from your final report. Limit
each section to 1-2 lines/figures. Your README should include the following sections:

Sample: https://github.com/bhagatsnehal/dog-breed-classification-model-deployment-AWS

3.1 Introduction
• Purpose of this Git repo (mention how this is a project that attempts to re-implement
your paper of choice)
• Introduce the paper chosen and its main contribution.
3.2 Chosen Result
• Identify the specific result you aimed to reproduce and its significance in the context
of the paper’s main contribution(s).
• Include the relevant figure, table, or equation reference from the original paper.
3.3 GitHub Contents
• Make a brief note about the content structure of your project
3.4 Re-implementation Details
• Describe your approach to re-implementation or experimentation.
• Include key details about models, datasets, tools, and evaluation metrics.
• Mention any challenges or modifications made to the original approach.
3.5 Reproduction Steps
As meta as this section is, it essentially documents steps someone would need to follow to
implement your GitHub repo in a local environment.

• Describe ”how someone using your GitHub can re-implement your re-implementation?”
• Provide instructions for running your code, including any dependencies, required li-
braries, and command-line arguments.
• Specify the computational resources (e.g., GPU) needed to reproduce your results.
3.6 Results/Insights
• Present your re-implementation results as a comparison to the original paper’s findings.
Describes ”what can someone expect as the end-result of using your GitHub repo?”
3.7 Conclusion
• Summarize the key takeaways from your re-implementation effort and the lessons
learned.
3.8 References
• Include a list of references, including the original paper and any additional resources
used in your re-implementation.
3.9 Acknowledgements
• Recognition goes a long way in setting up the context of your work. Your acknowl-
edgements also act as an indirect validation about the quality of the work. For eg.
having done this project as part of coursework is a sign
